Hello, thanks for looking my personal github repository! Here is the brief descriptions of each project. 

PhotosApp_tmp is a andorid app written in Java. The app could create, rename, and delete albums. After loading photos in one album, you could delete, move, and edit tags of the photos. you could also search for photos according to their tags. If you want to try this app, you could download the app_release.apk file to install it on your andorid phone. 

Classification is a machine learning project written in Python. It contains a naive Bayes image classifier, a perceptron classifier and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. The classifers can be tested by the digit and face image data. You could see the project description at https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp11/projects/classification/classification.html. Note that k-nearest neighbor classifier is not included in the description.
