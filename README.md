Hello, thanks for looking my personal github repository! Here is the brief descriptions of each project. 

PhotosApp_tmp is a andorid app written in Java. The app could create, rename, and delete albums. After loading photos in one album, you could delete, move, and edit tags of the photos. You could also search for photos according to their tags, and watch different photos by swiping screen. If you want to try this app, you could download the app_release.apk file to install it on your andorid phone. 

Classification is a machine learning project written in Python. It contains a naive Bayes image classifier, a perceptron classifier and a k-nearest neighbor classifier. The classifers can be tested by the digit and face image data. You could see the project description at https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/sp11/projects/classification/classification.html. Note that k-nearest neighbor classifier is not included in the description. 

LL(1) Parser is a praser written in Scheme, a functional programming language. It could generate the first, follow and predict sets of a random LL(1) grammar language. A parser is used to provide syntactic analysis of the input code into its component parts in order to facilitate the writing of compilers and interpreters. In other words, the project is part of a compiler as well as a practice of functional programming. 

GraphMatching is a Parallel Graph Matching project written in C. A Matching in a graph is a set of pairwise edges such that no two edges share a common vertex. A maximum matching is a matching where the total weight of the edges is maximized. Basically, the project implements the one-way handshaking algorthim to find the maximum matching of each input graph. It is parallelized to become more efficient.
